# My-wordpress-theme
 This is a wordpress theme created based on the theme provided by FreeCodeCamp.org
 You can check the Youtube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KibbYf9avko&t=12701s]
 
 This theme is being used in my personal blog website. 

 As I didn't add customized fields to this theme, you need to customize this theme by changing the source code.
